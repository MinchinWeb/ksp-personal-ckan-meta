# MinchinWeb's Private CKAN Metadata Repo

This makes various mods available to CKAN, which for whatever reason haven't
been added to the main CKAN metadata repo.

To use this:

1. Install CKAN
2. On the menu: *Settings* --> *CKAN Settings*
3. Under *Metadata Repositories* (the top box), click the "New" button.
4. Select whatever name you want (suggestion: "MinchinWeb") and set the URL to
   `https://github.com/MinchinWeb/ksp-personal-ckan-meta/archive/master.tar.gz`.
   Click "Add".
5. Close the settings.
6. Refresh CKAN.
7. Profit! Install the mods as needed.
